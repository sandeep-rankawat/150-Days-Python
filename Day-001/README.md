# Python Day 1 : Basics and Introduction
Python Day 1 typically covers the fundamental introduction to Python programming and essential basics that beginners need to know. Here's what students usually learn on Day 1:
## Chapter-1 : Introduction
Basic intro like what can we do in python and how we write it.
```python
import pyjokes # importing pyjokes module in current file

a = 4  # a is integer 
```
here a is integer type but we didn't specifically tells that it is not integer but python detects it is an integer same goes for

```python
b = 6.5 # b is float
c = True # c is boolean
d = "Rajveer" # d is string
print((a+b+c)/2*5, d)
e = None
```
