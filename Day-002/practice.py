num = int(input("Enter the number: "))
divisor = int(input("Enter the divisor: "))
print("The Remainder is ", num%divisor)

# Problem 2: Tell wehther the num is bigger or not
istrue = num>divisor
print("The given number is bigger than divisor(True/False): ", istrue)

# Problem 3: Find average of two numbers
print("The average of two number is ", (num+divisor)/2)

# Problem 4: Calculate the Square of number
